## Synopsis

This is an educational project to build a website with Javascript code that can interpret a given input and reproduce an encrypted response. The Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is one of the simplest forms of encryption. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (called the plaintext) is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters up or down in the alphabet.


## Motivation

During the course of my programming journey, I've come across many different brain teaser questions and I wanted to reproduce this with a visual representation.
